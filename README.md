# wolves-fc

This was my very first project (year 2018) that I and my partner Jou worked on as the school computer science club project for the contest

It's so poorly written and confusingly structured, but what can I say? 4 months of just scratching the surface and seeing if this development thing is for me or not is so little compared to 3 years of learning and experimenting.

Anyway this project carries so many precious memories for me. Jou and I intend to re-build it together soon like the old days XD
