This was my very first project (year 2018) as our (me and my friend jou) project in the computer lab activity.
It's so poorly written and structured,but what can I say 4 months of just scratching the surface and seeing if this development thing is for me is so little compared to 3 years of learning and experimenting.
Anyway this project carries so many memories to me precious ones actually and I would never feel the embarrassment of listing it in my portfolio unless I was asked to show some of my work back when I was just starting.
Then why just make a better version of it and keep the old one for nostalgia? CZ the only way I would have the motive to do it is if jou did it with me other than that I don wanna be alone...
